 When the game starts, the user will select a category of words to guess. After choosingthe category, the game select a random word, which it will not tell the user. 
 The user will then be prompted
 to choose a letter of the alphabet. If that letter occurs in the word, then the game will display the word with only the correctly guessed letters visible.
E.g. The game selects elephant as the word
The user chooses the letter e
The game displays e_e_____
The user chooses the letter t
The game displays e_e____t
The game will give the user a limited number of chances to guess the word. If the user completely guesses the word before running out of chances, then they win. Otherwise they lose.
If the user types exit instead of a letter, the program should exit
Have different categories of words, e.g.names of animals, teams, districts,films, books, and allow the user to select a category when the game starts.
Ask the user if they want to play again when the game is finished
